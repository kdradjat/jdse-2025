## Submission Format
Submissions must be in the form of an extended abstract and must adopt the style of the Springer Publications format for [Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). We accept submissions in PDF format, in English, consisting of 1 to 3 pages and containing an abstract, the context and research problem, the proposed approach, and the implemented or considered contribution. A list of keywords and references is required. Master students are encouraged to contribute even if only preliminary results are available at the time of submission. <br>
