<ins>Title</ins>: Learning with Missing Values: Theoretical Insights and Practical recommendations <br>
<ins>Abstract</ins>: Missing values are ubiquitous in many fields such as health, business or social sciences. To date, much of the literature on missing values has focused on imputation as well as inference with incomplete data. In contrast, supervised learning in the presence of missing values has received little attention. In this talk I will explain the challenges posed by missing values in regression and classification tasks. In practice, a common solution consists in imputing the missing values prior to learning. We will first examine the theoretical foundations of Impute-then-Regress approaches, and then clarify if and when investing in advanced imputation methods leads to significantly better predictions in practice. <br>
<ins>Biography</ins>: Marine Le Morvan is a research scientist at Inria. She is passionate about using AI to tackle complex scientific and healthcare problems, ensuring that machine learning models are both powerful and reliable. Her research lies at the intersection of statistical learning and trustworthy AI, with a focus on:
    * Tabular foundation models, which unlock new possibilities through large-scale pretraining.
    * Model auditing, to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of machine learning systems.
    * Learning from incomplete data, a challenge pervasive in fields like healthcare and social sciences.

<ins>Title</ins>: The Application of Agentic AI in Network Automation<br>
<ins>Abstract</ins>: The presentation explores the transformative potential of agentic AI in the realm of network automation. The platform leverages intelligent assistance through advanced intentionanalysis mechanisms, allowing clients to describe their needs in natural language. These need are then seemlessly translated into precise network configuration using Large Language Models (LLMs). The result is a powerful end-to-end automated process that enhances efficiency and reduces manual effort for networkmanagement. This innovative approach marks a significant step forward in deploying AI-driven solutions for network automation. <br>
<ins>Biography</ins>: Sihem Cherrared received a master's degree in networks and distributed systems from the University of Science and Technology, Algeria, in 2015. She defended her PhD degree in 2020 at the University of Rennes 1, France, in INRIA and Orange Labs, focusing on the fault management of programmable multi-tenant networks. She held an R&D enginner position at Smile in Paris before joining Orange Innovation in 2022. She is currently working as research enginner and project leader on network automation. She is member of the IEEE ComSoc AI driven communications industry community. The topics of interests are the intent-based management and network automation.
