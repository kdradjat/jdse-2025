<ins>Title</ins>: The Application of Agentic AI in Network Automation<br>
<ins>Abstract</ins>: The presentation explores the transformative potential of agentic AI in the realm of network automation. The platform leverages intelligent assistance through advanced intentionanalysis mechanisms, allowing clients to describe their needs in natural language. These need are then seemlessly translated into precise network configuration using Large Language Models (LLMs). The result is a powerful end-to-end automated process that enhances efficiency and reduces manual effort for networkmanagement. This innovative approach marks a significant step forward in deploying AI-driven solutions for network automation. <br>
<ins>Biography</ins>: Sihem Cherrared received a master's degree in networks and distributed systems from the University of Science and Technology, Algeria, in 2015. She defended her PhD degree in 2020 at the University of Rennes 1, France, in INRIA and Orange Labs, focusing on the fault management of programmable multi-tenant networks. She held an R&D enginner position at Smile in Paris before joining Orange Innovation in 2022. She is currently working as research enginner and project leader on network automation. She is member of the IEEE ComSoc AI driven communications industry community. The topics of interests are the intent-based management and network automation.
